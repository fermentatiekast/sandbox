Just a means to try out various integrations


## Python development
We will use `venv` to set up an environment.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This directory should not be versioned!

We can use it to configure your shell for python development.

## Behave
We will use [behave][behave] as a tool for integration.
